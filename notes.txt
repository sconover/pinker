things i like

- terse, readable specification in one place about how an object graph ought to be constrained.
- the grammar metaphor helps me think
- how rules are applied to parts of the object

iffy

predicates
autogen stuff...delete it out of predicated, even?
conditions, finders, holders.  too much code / not elegant / too many little choices?


what do I want to read?

bind_rule(object, rule(Shirt))  #the first rule


Grammar.new(Shirt) do

  bind_rule(object, rule(Shirt))

  rule(Shirt) do
    condition{@buttons.each{|button|bind_rule(button, Button)}}
  end
end
